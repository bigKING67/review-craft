# Integration Boundaries

## Codex Review

Prefer the host's ordinary review for a bounded PR, commit, branch range, or working
tree change. Review Craft v0.1 is deliberately repository-wide and higher cost.
Compare the workflows only on matched scope, revision, model, reasoning, and output
constraints. Do not infer superiority from Review Craft's self-score.

## Design Craft

Use Design Craft when the primary question is visual hierarchy, product UI/UX,
motion, interaction, accessibility presentation, design systems, or browser/native
visual evidence. Review Craft may inspect frontend architecture and measured runtime
performance, but it should not replace visual judgment or screenshot validation.

## Codex Security

Use Codex Security for threat models, vulnerability discovery, source-to-sink paths,
exploitability, attack-path analysis, PoCs, severity, and security fix verification.
Review Craft may flag a candidate for escalation and may later import structured
results. Imported results must preserve finding identity, severity, confidence, and
provenance. Review Craft must not weaken or silently reinterpret a validated security
finding.

Evaluate integration fidelity rather than claiming that a general engineering review
is a stronger security scan.
